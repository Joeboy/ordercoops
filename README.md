==========

This is a django project we use to organise a smallish online wholefoods order
which is split between several people. This is probably not of much interest
to anybody else. It's grown organically and messily so the code kind of sucks.

To get it working, make sure you have django 1.5 installed, check out the
project, rename localsettings.py.dist to localsettings.py and edit it
according to your needs. Good luck.
